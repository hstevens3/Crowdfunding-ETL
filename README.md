# Module 8 Challenge SQL

# Crowdfunding-ETL

## Overview of the Project

This challenge is to practice ETL tools. Data was extracted from a csv file and processed with Pandas to create a data frame. The data frame was exported to csv. An ERD diagram was created with the QuickDBD tool. The Postgres SQL export from QuickDBD was used to create tables. SQL queries were written and executed on the tables and the new tables were exported to csv.
